# BatchPong
This is a Pong clone that I started in middle school (2016). I gave up on it when I ran into some serious bugs, before coming back and finishing it now (2020). It is written in pure Batch (Windows CMD shell commands).

# How to Play
Download BatchPong.bat onto your computer, and run it. The controls are:
- W/S for Player 1
- I/K for Player 2
- [ENTER] to unfreeze key input when needed

The game works better on a beefier computer. I tested it on Windows 10.
As it is written in pure batch, the game may flicker occassionally.

# Notes
- The game creates a "BatchPong" folder in AppData to store scores and some game-related stuff.
- Commands required to be on your system include: taskkill, tasklist, xcopy, choice
